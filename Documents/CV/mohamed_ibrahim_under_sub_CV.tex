\item{\bf Nile University (NU) \hfill {\bf June 2012 -- June 2013}}\\
{\it Research Software Development Engineer (RSDE)} \hfill {\bf Giza, Egypt}\\
{\it Advisor:} Associate Professor \href{https://sites.google.com/site/telbatt/}{Tamer ElBatt}\\
My role was to conduct research and create functional prototypes related to predictive loading of content on mobile phones based on user modeling. The results of this work are published in ICC 2014 and MobiSys 2013. 

\item{\bf Inmobly \hfill {\bf October 2011 -- June 2013}}\\
{\it Software Engineer} \hfill {\bf Giza, Egypt}\\
{\it Manager:} Professor \href{https://ece.osu.edu/people/elgamal}{Hesham ElGamal}\\ 
{\it Mentor:} Associate Professor \href{https://eg.linkedin.com/in/nwanas}{Nayer Wanas}\\
% {\it Projects:} PAUL, inFootball, Agenda25\\
My role was to implement some of the required functionalities for several mobile applications. In {\it PAUL}, I implemented logging and reporting modules (for WiÂ­Fi, content usage and battery), and scripts to analyze the logs and to build the user profile to correctly predict the different users' behavior. In {\it inFootball}, I implemented the news crawler and the handlers for the different client-side requests. In {\it Agenda25}, I implemented the BlackBerry version of the application.

% Worked on PAUL - Predictive Automated User-Centric Loading technology that offers an innovative solution for the bandwidth crunch problems facing wireless operators. PAUL utilizes the predictability of user behavior to offload the peak traffic on cellular network by utilizing non-peak intervals and/or WI-FI networks. 
% I was mainly involved in back-end logic; developing scheduling algorithms responsible for offloading the peak traffic. Many challenges were considered like: 
% - For each user which content will be rerouted and to which interval,
% - which intervals to choose to maximize content freshness,
% - uncertainty about which intervals will be available,
% - the available Bandwidth in each,
% - uncertainty about the content to be consumed by the user

% $\bullet$ Proposed various techniques to improve the performance and energy efficiency of GPU hardware.
% Researched on efficient execution of multiple contexts/applications on next generation GPUs.
% The results of this work are published in GPGPU 2014 (co-located with ASPLOS 2014).
% Implemented and evaluated micro-architecture techniques for Intel's ultra-low power core ({\it Siskiyou}).
% This infrastructure is released to universities to perform research on energy-efficient architectures.
