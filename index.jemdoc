== About
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research AMD Research]. My research interests include all aspects of computer architecture, specifically data-parallel architectures, CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures, and interconnection networks. 

I completed my Ph.D. studies in the Department of Computer Science at [http://www.wm.edu/ William & Mary], where I worked with Professor [http://adwaitjog.github.io/ Adwait Jog] in [http://insight-archlab.github.io/ Insight Computer Architecture Lab]. My dissertation focused on designing high-performance and energy-efficient GPU architectures with an emphasis on cache and interconnect design. Before joining William & Mary, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Engineering at [http://cu.edu.eg/Home Cairo University], Egypt.
