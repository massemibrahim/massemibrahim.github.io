== About
I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at William & Mary. My research interests include all aspects of computer architecture, specifically data-parallel architectures (e.g., GPUs), CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures, and interconnection networks. I am a research assistant in [http://insight-archlab.github.io/ Insight Computer Architecture Lab] advised by [http://adwaitjog.github.io/ Assistant Professor Adwait Jog]. 

I received my BSc and MSc in Computer Engineering from [http://cu.edu.eg/Home Cairo University], Egypt. My MSc thesis was supervised by [http://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=helboghdadi Professor Hatem El-Boghdadi]. While working as a teaching assistant at Cairo University, I was also a Research Software Development Engineer (RSDE) at [http://www.nileu.edu.eg/ Nile University] with [https://sites.google.com/site/telbatt/ Associate Professor Tamer ElBatt], and a Software Engineer at [http://www.inmobly.com/ Inmobly] with [http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~elgamal/ Professor Hesham ElGamal] and [https://eg.linkedin.com/in/nwanas Associate Professor Nayer Wanas].
